In this image I have successfuly completed all the steps needed in order to run osTicket. This includes all the background pieces that ensure everything will run properly. My next step will be to create users and assign them roles along with setting their permissions. This is what determines who will be writing tickets and who will be resolving them. I am able to set all this up because I made myself the root user.

In this image is an actual ticket that was submitted by the user Karen. As we can see John is logged in and it would be his duty to pick up this ticket and respond to it however he sees fit. The severty of the ticket would also determine how often he would have to check back in with the customer and what the next steps of action would be. Weather it be a quick fix he could handle or an issue that may require the help up his higher ups in his so called corporation.
